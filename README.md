# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

<!-- I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile-first responsive portfolio. -->

<!-- I created the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`. -->

<!-- I obtained and integrated a navbar from Bootstrap. -->

<!-- Made the layout responsive and used the Bootstrap grid layout of Container, Rows and Columns. -->

<!-- The image cards are responsive and shrink down to size on mobile devices -->

<!-- I did not use media queries except those built into Bootstrap -->

<!-- I created a repo for this homework -->

<!-- Deployed my application using github free hosting service. -->

<!-- Added a sticky footer to all pages. -->

<!-- ensured Navbar is consistent on each page. -->
